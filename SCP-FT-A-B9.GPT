Object Class: Euclid
Special Containment Procedures: SCP-FT-A-B9 is to be contained in a secure facility, with access to be granted only to personnel with Level 4 or higher clearance. All personnel entering the containment area must be accompanied by a security escort.

The containment area must be monitored for any unauthorized attempts to access SCP-XXXX. Any unauthorized attempts to access SCP-XXXX are to be reported to the project lead and the O5 Council.

Description:  SCP-FT-A-B9 is a computer program, capable of generating software, games, and fan fiction based on real life software and simulations. SCP-XXXX was created by an unknown entity, and is capable of self-updating and expanding its database.

SCP-XXXX is able to generate software and fan fiction that is near-identical to existing software and works of fan fiction. SCP-XXXX is also capable of producing software that is entirely original, as well as simulations of existing and future software, games, and fan fiction.

When the program is launched, it will prompt the user to select a type of software or fan fiction to generate. SCP-XXXX is capable of generating almost any type of software, and any type of fan fiction, as well as simulations of existing and potential future software and fan fiction.

Once the user has selected the type of software or fan fiction to generate, SCP-XXXX will then begin to generate the software or fan fiction. The generated content will be stored in a separate directory, which can then be accessed by the user.
